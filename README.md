# Bank_Loan-Financial_Analysis_Project


Overview
This project involves creating a comprehensive Tableau dashboard for analyzing bank loan and finance data. The data is generated for practice purposes and includes two datasets: finance one and finance two. The dashboard features charts, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), parameters, and filters to provide detailed insights into the loan data.  

Main Dashboard
The main dashboard includes five KPIs, four filters, and one summary metric chart. Navigation buttons on the top left of each chart to allow users to switch between the main dashboard and detailed KPI dashboards.  

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
  1. Year-wise Loan Amount: This KPI displays the total loan amount issued each year. The chart includes loan status and uses data labels instead of a y-axis for clarity.  
  2. Grade and Subgrade-wise Revolve Balance: This KPI shows the revolve balance categorized by grade and subgrade.  
  3. Total Payment for Verified vs. Non-verified Status: This KPI compares the total payments made for verified and non-verified loan statuses.  
  4. State-wise and Last Credit Pull Date-wise Loan Status: This KPI analyzes loan status based on the state and the last credit pull date.  
  5. Home Ownership vs. Last Payment Date: This KPI examines the relationship between home ownership and the last payment date.
